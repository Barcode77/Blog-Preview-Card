# What I learned
The blog preview challenge has taught me how adapt my approach to coding.
Taking time to see, and notice the structure, flow, first.
To spend my time in the inspect box more than development area. as its why i get to quickly test.
With this, I appreciated the work of community feedback, and how we write unorganized code that me be unreadable.
So i added comments. and whitespace to improve readability.
I also used feedback from previous projects,and used media queries!



```
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  body{
        width:330px;
    }

    h2{
        font-size: 2.0rem;
    }

    /*-------- P elements -----*/
    main p {
        font-size: 1.4rem;
    }
    .learning{
        font-size: 1.1rem;
    }
    .published {
        font-size: 1.2rem;
    }
    footer p{
        font-size: 1.3rem;
    }
```


### Continued development

In coming projects, i seek to improve on fonts. and responsive design
